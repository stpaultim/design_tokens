# Theme Tokens

Theme Tokens is a Backdrop CMS module that provides a modern, flexible approach to theme
configuration using CSS custom properties (CSS variables). It lets themes declare the design
tokens they support — colors, fonts, spacing, and more — and gives site administrators a
clean UI to configure those values without writing any CSS.

This module is intended as a replacement for the Color module, which predates CSS custom
properties and works by doing fragile string replacement on CSS files. Theme Tokens stores
values in Backdrop config, injects a single `:root {}` block in `<head>`, and never rewrites
any files.

# Status

Theme Tokens is under active development. The core infrastructure (token discovery, config
storage, CSS injection, admin UI, live preview) is in place. The color sub-module is
functional. It is not too early to test it, file bug reports, and provide feedback.

# Who is this module for?

Theme Tokens is for theme developers who want to give their users meaningful, well-organized
customization options that go beyond the Color module — and for site administrators who want
to configure a site's look and feel through the UI without custom CSS.

It is designed as an infrastructure module. Themes declare what they support; the module
handles the rest.

# How it works

1. A theme places a `tokens.inc` file in its root directory declaring the tokens it supports.
2. Theme Tokens discovers the file and loads the token definitions.
3. Sub-modules register token types (e.g. `theme_tokens_color`) and provide the field UI
   for editing them.
4. A site administrator visits **Appearance > Theme Tokens** and configures values through
   the admin UI, with a live preview of the site alongside the form.
5. Values are stored in Backdrop config: `theme.tokens.THEMENAME.json`
6. On every page, Theme Tokens injects a `<style>` block into `<head>`:

```html
<style>:root { --color-primary: #6e0e0a; --font-heading: Merriweather, serif; }</style>
```

The theme's CSS uses `var(--color-primary)` and friends. No CSS files are ever rewritten.

# Module structure

Theme Tokens uses a parent + sub-module architecture. The parent module provides shared
infrastructure. Sub-modules add support for specific token types. Sites enable only what
they need.

```
theme_tokens/               Infrastructure: token loading, CSS injection, admin UI, config
  modules/
    theme_tokens_color/     Color token type — color pickers, preset scheme selection
    theme_tokens_font/      Font token type — font selectors, stacks (planned)
```

A site that wants only color control enables `theme_tokens` and `theme_tokens_color`. A site
that wants both color and font control enables all three. Third-party developers can add new
token types as additional sub-modules without touching the parent.

# Adding Theme Tokens support to a theme

Place a `tokens.inc` file in your theme's root directory. The module detects it automatically.

```php
<?php
$info = array(
  'variables_file' => 'css/my-theme-variables.css',

  'groups' => array(
    'header'     => t('Header & Footer'),
    'typography' => t('Typography'),
  ),

  'tokens' => array(
    'color-primary' => array(
      'label'   => t('Primary background'),
      'type'    => 'color',
      'default' => '#6e0e0a',
      'group'   => 'header',
    ),
    'font-heading' => array(
      'label'   => t('Heading font'),
      'type'    => 'font',
      'default' => 'Merriweather, Georgia, serif',
      'group'   => 'typography',
    ),
  ),

  'schemes' => array(
    'default' => array(
      'title'  => t('Default'),
      'tokens' => array(
        'color-primary' => '#6e0e0a',
        'font-heading'  => 'Merriweather, Georgia, serif',
      ),
    ),
  ),
);
```

The `variables_file` key tells Theme Tokens which static CSS file to remove from the page
and replace with the injected `:root {}` block. This prevents duplicate variable definitions.

Token `type` values must match a type registered by an enabled sub-module. If the sub-module
for a type is not enabled, that token is silently skipped — the form simply won't show a
field for it, and its default value is still injected.

# Admin UI

- **Appearance > Theme Tokens** — overview of all themes with token support
- **Appearance > Theme Tokens > [Theme name]** — configure tokens for a specific theme

The settings page shows tokens organized by group, a preset scheme selector at the top, and
a live preview of the front page alongside the form. Changes are reflected in the preview
in real time without a page reload.

# Goals

- Provide a clean, config-based replacement for the Color module
- Support any token type (colors, fonts, spacing, border radius, etc.) through sub-modules
- Live preview with no server round-trips, using `postMessage`
- Exportable, deployable, version-controllable config
- Opera is the reference implementation and primary test case

# Reference implementation

The [Opera theme](https://github.com/backdrop-contrib/opera) is the first theme to support
Theme Tokens and serves as the reference implementation during development.
