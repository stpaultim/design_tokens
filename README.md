# Design Tokens

Design Tokens is a Backdrop CMS module that provides a modern, flexible approach to theme
configuration using CSS custom properties (CSS variables). Themes declare the design tokens
they support — colors, fonts, border radius, button styles, and more — and site architects
configure those values through a clean admin UI without writing any CSS.

This module is a replacement for the Color module, which predates CSS custom properties and
works by doing fragile string replacement on CSS files. 

Design Tokens stores values inBackdrop config, injects a single `:root {}` block in `<head>`, 
and never rewrites any files.

  :root {
    --color-primary: #6e0e0a;
    --color-primary-text: #fff6ff;
  }

The theme's CSS is written to use those variable names — color: var(--color-primary) —
rather than hardcoded values. When an admin changes a color, Design Tokens just updates that
one block. No files are rewritten. No cache needs to be cleared for the change to take effect.

The practical differences for a site architect:

  - Faster — changes apply immediately without rebuilding CSS files
  - Safer — nothing is permanently rewritten; the original theme files are untouched
  - More flexible — one token can drive many things at once (Opera's primary color controls
    the nav bar, footer, buttons, links, and borders all from a single setting)

## Status

Design Tokens is functional and actively used with the Opera theme as the reference
implementation. The core infrastructure, color sub-module, font sub-module, and utility
sub-module are all complete. It is not too early to test it, file bug reports, and provide
feedback.

## Who is this module for?

**Theme developers** who want to give site architects meaningful, well-organized customization
options without the Color module's limitations.

**Site architects** who want to configure a site's look and feel through the admin UI — colors,
fonts, button styles, link behavior — without custom CSS.

It is an infrastructure module. Themes declare what they support; the module handles the rest.

## How it works

1. A theme places a `tokens.inc` file in its root directory declaring the tokens it supports.
2. Design Tokens discovers the file and loads the token definitions.
3. Sub-modules register token types (e.g. `design_tokens_color`) and provide the field UI.
4. A site architect visits **Appearance > Design Tokens** and configures values with a live
   preview of the site alongside the form.
5. Values are stored in Backdrop config: `theme.tokens.THEMENAME.json`
6. On every page, Design Tokens injects a `<style>` block into `<head>`:

```html
<style>:root { --color-primary: #6e0e0a; --font-heading: 'Merriweather', serif; }</style>
```

The theme's CSS uses `var(--color-primary)` and similar references. No CSS files are
ever rewritten.

## Module structure

Design Tokens uses a parent + sub-module architecture. The parent provides shared
infrastructure. Sub-modules add support for specific token types. Sites enable only what
they need.

```
design_tokens/               Infrastructure: token loading, CSS injection, admin UI, config
  modules/
    design_tokens_color/     Color tokens — color pickers, contrast ratio badges, schemes
    design_tokens_font/      Font tokens — font family selectors, Google Fonts integration
    design_tokens_utility/   Utility CSS — generates classes like .dt-bg-primary for use
                             in the layout editor; includes admin reference page
```

A site wanting only color control enables `design_tokens` + `design_tokens_color`. A site
wanting color, fonts, and utility classes enables all four. Third-party developers can add
new token types as additional sub-modules without touching the parent.

## Adding Design Tokens support to a theme

Place a `tokens.inc` file in your theme's root directory. The module detects it automatically.

```php
<?php
$info = array(
  // Static CSS file to remove when Design Tokens is active (prevents duplicate variables).
  'variables_file' => 'css/my-theme-variables.css',

  'groups' => array(
    'header'     => t('Header & Footer'),
    'typography' => t('Typography'),
  ),

  'tokens' => array(
    'color-primary' => array(
      'label'   => t('Background'),
      'type'    => 'color',       // Provided by design_tokens_color
      'default' => '#6e0e0a',
      'group'   => 'header',
      'utility' => TRUE,          // Generate a .dt-bg-primary utility class
    ),
    'font-heading' => array(
      'label'   => t('Heading font'),
      'type'    => 'font',        // Provided by design_tokens_font
      'default' => "'Merriweather', Georgia, serif",
      'group'   => 'typography',
    ),
  ),

  'schemes' => array(
    'default' => array(
      'title'  => t('Default'),
      'tokens' => array(
        'color-primary' => '#6e0e0a',
      ),
    ),
  ),
);
```

### Token keys

| Key | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `label` | Yes | Human-readable label shown in the admin UI |
| `type` | Yes | Token type (`color`, `font`, `text`). Unknown types show a plain text field. |
| `default` | Yes | Default CSS value used before any config is saved |
| `group` | No | Groups the token under a collapsible fieldset |
| `utility` | No | If `TRUE`, `design_tokens_utility` generates a utility CSS class for this token |

### Preset schemes

Schemes are named sets of token values. When a scheme is selected in the admin UI, all
fields populate at once. The selected scheme name is saved to config and pre-selected on
the next visit. If any token value is changed after a scheme is applied, the selector
automatically shows "Custom" — verified server-side on save.

### Utility classes

When `design_tokens_utility` is enabled, tokens with `'utility' => TRUE` generate CSS
classes that site architects can apply to blocks in the layout editor's CSS class field:

- **Color tokens** — `.dt-bg-{slug}` sets background, text, and link color together
- **Font tokens** — `.dt-font-{slug}` (all text) and `.dt-title-{slug}` (block title only)

The reference page at **Appearance > Design Tokens > [Theme] > Utility Classes** shows all
available classes with live color swatches.

## Admin UI

| Path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `admin/appearance/tokens` | Overview — all themes with token support |
| `admin/appearance/tokens/[theme]` | Configure tokens for a specific theme |
| `admin/appearance/tokens/[theme]/utilities` | Utility class reference page |

The settings page shows tokens organized by group, a preset scheme selector, WCAG contrast
ratio badges on color pairs, and a live preview of the front page. Changes reflect in the
preview instantly via `postMessage` — no page reload required.

## Theme-specific admin preview JS

If a theme provides `js/design-tokens-theme.js`, Design Tokens automatically loads it on
the token settings admin page. This allows themes to extend the live preview with logic
that can't be handled by token injection alone — for example, computed CSS properties
derived from token values at PHP render time.

## Goals

- Config-based replacement for the Color module
- Support any token type through sub-modules
- Live preview with no server round-trips
- Exportable, deployable, version-controllable config
- Accessible by default — WCAG contrast checking built in

## Reference implementation

The [Opera theme](https://github.com/backdrop-contrib/opera) is the first theme to support
Design Tokens and serves as the reference implementation during development.
